# Project 1 - Klotski Game

## Description:

The objective for this project is to develop a problem solving Artificial Intelligence Agent capable of finding a solution to the game Klotski using different search algorithms.
Klotski is a sliding block puzzle game, with different sized blocks being placed usually inside a 4x5 frame. The goal of the game is to move a special 2x2 block to a designated area without removing blocks, only sliding the blocks horizontally or vertically.

## How to run:
In order to run the program, you must have python installed on your machine.
To run the program, you must run the following command on the root directory of the project:
```
python game.py
```
The game window will then open and you will be able to choose to play, to see help documentation or to quit from the game.
If you choose to play, the program will ask you to choose the LEVEL you want to play.
After choosing the level, you will be able to choose between PLAYER MODE or PC MODE. In PLAYER MODE, you will be able to play the game by yourself, using the mouse to move the blocks, and you can check hints to help you get to the solution. In PC MODE, you need to choose the search algorithm you want to use to solve the game and after that the program will solve the game and show you the solution.
